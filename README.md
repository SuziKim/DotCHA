# DotCHA: A 3D Text-based Scatter-type CAPTCHA
We introduce a new type of 3D text-based CAPTCHA, called DotCHA, which relies on human interaction. DotCHA asks users to rotate a 3D text model to identify the correct letters. The 3D text model is a twisted form of sequential 3D letters around a center pivot axis, and it shows different letters depending on the rotation angle. The model is not composed of a solid letter model, but a number of spheres to resist character segmentation attacks, and this is why DotCHA is classified as a scatter-type CAPTCHA. Since each letter can only be identified in a particular direction, it makes DotCHA resistant to machine learning attacks. We demonstrate that DotCHA, while maintaining usability, is resistant to existing types of attacks.
